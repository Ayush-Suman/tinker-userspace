Hi, it's awesome that you're interested in contributing to this repo. It's a work in progress and anything you contribute is great.

1. Download and run the code on your machine. Play around with it.
2. Check issues - They already contain many possible improvements. If you feel something is missing just add an issue.
3. Make PRs - You can make a PR for an existing issue or something you want to add to the project.

That's it folks. It's a simple project mostly intended for self-exploration. Go crazy.
